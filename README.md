# Machine Learning Thinking — 30 Days

This repository documents a 30-day learning journey focused on 
**how to think like a data scientist**, rather than just training models.

Instead of jumping directly into complex algorithms, this project emphasizes:
- Problem framing before modeling
- Feature thinking and real-world availability
- Data leakage awareness
- Proper evaluation metrics for imbalanced problems
- Building meaningful baseline models

The main case study used in this repository is a **credit card fraud detection** problem,
but the principles learned here are applicable to many real-world machine learning tasks.
